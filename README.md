# Snake-Game
It is a simple Snake Game made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It was my one of the initial game project.
In this, you will notice that there are 2 elements, An Apple and a Chilly. When the snake will eat Apple, it size will grow and points will be added. But, If snake eats out chilly, the point will be Zero(0) and the snake size will becoime initial. 
Also it is not like the old game where if snake touches the side wall or bites itself, the will be over.
